# Prolog Exploration - Project 4

## Name: Maria Mills

## Issues:

- Understanding Prolog. It's not what I'm used to at all, I think I understand a concept such as knowledge base, facts and rules and then I'm hit with another example in the book and I find myself lost again.
- I found myself constantly trying to code imperatively and writing instructions sequentially. I had to keep reminding myself that Prolog is a declarative language and that I need to think in terms of facts and rules.. which is still hard for me to grasp fully. Understanding the concept and executing it are two different things.
- With `sort/2` predicate, I kept getting the result `[ ,M,a,i,l,r,s]` and I could not figure out why. It turns out that `sort/2` removes duplicates... which is **clearly** stated in the documentation, I just kept reading too fast, lesson definitely learned. This lead to me to discover `msort/2` which does not remove duplicates.

## Part 2a

### Step 1:

1. Create a variable `Name` and assign it your first and last name.

2. Sort and return your nameâ€™s characters in alphabetical order. (See `sort.pl` for the code.)

3. Reverse and return your name. (See `reverse.pl` for the code.)
