# Erlang - Project 6

## Name: Maria Mills

### Step 2:

- I'm using this as my freebie.

#### Resources

- (While I was trying to attempt to do this, didn't get far however):
- The book
- The slides
- [learnxinyminutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/erlang/)
-

##### What I didn't like:

- I don't like the syntax but I didn't really put much effort into it honestly... I felt 'languaged' out, if that makes sense.
- With that being said that I don't like the syntax, I also did not like the functional nature of Erlang.

##### What I liked:

- I honestly can't say I liked anything about Erlang, but to be fair, like I said, I didn't really give it a chance or put much effort into it. I was just honestly over it... (sorry).
- I did like the fact that I was able to complete the first step with no real issues, but that's about it.
