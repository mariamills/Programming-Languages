### Step 2:

1. Create a string assigned to the variable FirstName
   ![alt text](image.png)

2. Create a string assigned to the variable LastName
   ![alt text](image-1.png)

3. Create a string assigned to the variable Name that concatenates FirstName and LastName, removing any blank characters
   ![alt text](image-2.png)

4. Sort and display Nameâ€™s characters in alphabetical order
   ![alt text](image-3.png)

5. Reverse and display Name
   ![alt text](image-4.png)

6. Sort and display Name in reverse alphabetical order
   ![alt text](image-5.png)

##### What I didn't like:

- I don't know how I exactly feel about it's functional programming style, I'm not sure if I like it or not, it's just different.

##### What I liked:

- I also liked how easy it was to find resources, anything I wanted to know how to do was a simple Google search away.
- I like the lack of parentheses, especially after working with Clojure.
