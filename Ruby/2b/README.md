# Project 2b - Six Little Words
## Name: Maria Mills
## Issues: None
## Three things I liked about this project:
1. I liked learning about the various loops in Ruby, Ruby offers a lot of different ways to loop through code, some being kind of weird (or really just unfamiliar syntax) but convenient.
2. While I stated that I disliked some of the syntax for Ruby, I also liked *some* of the syntax for Ruby. Such as, the 'until' loop, at first it was a little confusing to me, but I like that it's a little different from the 'while' loop, and I like that it's a *little* more readable than the 'while' loop. 'Until *this* happens, keep doing *this*'.
3. I really like the `.times` method, it's very convenient and easy to use. It's super simple and EASY to understand, much simpler than a for loop with a counter, honestly, this should be offered in more languages.

## Three things I disliked about this project:
1. I disliked *some* of the syntax for Ruby in general, dislike is a strong word but I'm not the biggest fan of some of the syntax. Such as the '@' for instance variables, I don't like that it's not consistent with the rest of the variables (same for '@@' with class variables, which is honestly kind of confusing for me right now). I also prefer curly braces over the 'end' keyword, but I understand that it's a preference thing.
2. This is a ***really small*** thing and not really a big deal at all (just me nit picking) but I don't really like how the uppercase method is `upcase`, mostly because I'm use to `toUpperCase` or even `upper` but now it's throwing in a whole new word, I know it's not a big deal but it's just a little annoying, it's something that could of easily been `upper` or `upper_case` or something. Especially since the syntax reminds me of Python, it could of just been `upper` like in Python. 
3. I really did not like the syntax for block parameters, it is what took me longest to wrap my head around honestly. The `| |` inside the code blocks, it really threw me off when I first saw it in examples, I was like "what is that for, what is it doing?". I understand now that it's meant for parameters, but it's still a little weird to me. I'm not sure if it's just because I'm not use to it, but I wasn't a fan of it.
